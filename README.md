Senior Design Project

Code development for our senior design project. Coded in Python, we have created a notification system to be used on a Raspberry Pi Pico W with several button inputs 
and a screen output. 

Uploaded are several basic iterations of our python code. This code has been used to create the basic logic of our project, which has been collectively combined to create 
our final python project.
